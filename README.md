*adjective: cardinal*

*of the greatest importance; fundamental*
## Overview

 This idea has the potential to introduce much needed reforms in the traditional toll collection systems, which in many countries is still cash only. The registration will be swift and easy for users, who most likely will only need to share a picture of their driver's license, vehicle number and email.
 
 For the registration process, access tokens will be verified via GoogleAuthO. Once the user is registered, users will be able to deposit FIAT money into the account. In the post-COVID19 world, contactless payments will be made via a QR code. The user will scan the code and the program will verify account balance by maintaining an ERC20 balance and transferring for each deduction, which provides automation and transparency.
