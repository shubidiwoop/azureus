*adjective: cardinal*

*of the greatest importance; fundamental*
## Overview 
Cardinal team has identified the lack of a frictionless transaction process at toll gates and is designing a decentralized solution that allows a toll authority to conduct secure transactions by cutting out untrustworthy middlemen and on-chain verification.

## Usage

 This idea has the potential to introduce much needed reforms in the traditional toll collection systems, which in many countries is still cash only. The registration will be swift and easy for users, who most likely will only need to share a picture of their driver's license, vehicle number and email.
 
 For the registration process, access tokens will be verified via GoogleAuthO. Once the user is registered, users will be able to deposit FIAT money into the account. In the post-COVID19 world, contactless payments will be made via a QR code. The user will scan the code and the program will verify account balance by maintaining an ERC20 balance and transferring for each deduction, which provides automation and transparency.

## Credits

We have designed this full-stack dapps using the support provided by [EthVigilâ€™s APIs](https://ethvigil.com/). 
Even more so, storage and encryption of user and toll data is made possible using [Fleek](https://docs.fleek.co/), which is built on IPFS, Textile, and Filecoin. We will keep you updated on the additional functionalities that will be added to the projects.
